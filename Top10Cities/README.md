# Top 10 Cities
This example will find the top 10 cities that generated the most number of unique tweets from a collection of Twitter data.

The data is from the full_text.txt file and consists of a user ID, a timestamp, latitude and longitude coordinates and the tweet content.  First a list of nearby cities will be generated by using the cities15000.txt file and, from this list, the closest city to the orginating location of the tweet will be found. Finally, a list of aggregate counts of all cities will be generated and the top 10 results will be listed.
