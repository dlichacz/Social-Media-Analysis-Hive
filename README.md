MostPopularHashtags.q
-------------

This script file will find the top 5 hashtags from full_text.txt.  For this example, a hashtag is defined to be any string that starts with '#' and contains numbers, letters or underscores.

Top10Cities.q
-------------

This script file will find the top 10 cities that generated the most number of unique tweets from full_text.txt.  First a list of nearby cities will be generated by using the cities15000.txt file and, from this list, the closest city to the orginating location of the tweet will be found. Finally, a list of aggregate counts of all cities will be generated and the top 10 results will be listed.
